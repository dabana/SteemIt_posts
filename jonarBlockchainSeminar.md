# The Blockchain Cocktail&Code: a good start for a promising event series on blockchain in Montreal 

This thursday June 7th I attended the first edition of the [Blockchain Cocktail&Code](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Blockchain-Skills-Development-developpement-de-competences/events/250077085/) [Noteman House](http://notman.org/). This an event was ment to bring together the blockchain community in a relaxed atmosphere. [Akaash Mukherjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akaash-mukherjee/), the initiator of the event wants to make it a recurrent event taking place every 2-3 months or so. He has ambitous goals, but judging by the attendence of this first event, the interest for blockchain in Montreal is definetly ramping up.

The event started by a cocktail form 19h to 20h where there were at least 70 persons packed on the terrace of the Noteman house. The atmophere.
