# The Blockchain Cocktail&Code: a good start for a promising event series on blockchain in Montreal 

This thursday June 7th I attended the first edition of the [Blockchain Cocktail&Code](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Blockchain-Skills-Development-developpement-de-competences/events/250077085/) [Noteman House](http://notman.org/). This an event was ment to bring together the blockchain community in a relaxed atmosphere. [Akaash Mukherjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akaash-mukherjee/), the initiator of the event wants to make it a recurrent event taking place every 2-3 months or so. He has ambitous goals, but judging by the attendence of this first event, the interest for blockchain in Montreal is definetly ramping up.

The event started by a cocktail form 19h to 20h where there were at least 70 persons packed on the terrace of the Noteman house. The atmophere was chill, there were all kinds of people, it was fun! At 20h there was a live demonstration of how to create your own developpement environment for coding and deploying smart contracts on ethereum. A cool journey in the world of smart contracts. Even though it was pretty technical, a lot of people stayed with there laptop in the Osmo Cafe until pretty late!
