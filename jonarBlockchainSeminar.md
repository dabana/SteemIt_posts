# The Blockchain Cocktail&Code: a good start for a promising event series on blockchain in Montreal 

This thursday June 7th I attended the first edition of the [Blockchain Cocktail&Code](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Blockchain-Skills-Development-developpement-de-competences/events/250077085/) [Noteman House](http://notman.org/). This an event was ment to bring together the blockchain community in a relaxed atmosphere. [Akaash Mukherjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akaash-mukherjee/), the initiator of the event, wants to make it recurrent every 2-3 months or so. Judging by the attendence of this first event, I think the interest for blockchain in Montreal is definetly ramping up.

The event started with a cocktail form 19h to 20h where there were at least 70 persons packed on the terrace of the Noteman house. The atmophere was chill, there were all kinds of people, it was fun! I was impressed how diverse was the crowd who attended the event. There were web developpers eager to learn about the new blockchain stuff. There were experienced entrepreneurs seeking for the next big thing. There were students and researchs from university looking for new research questions. And finaly there were totally random citizens, simply wondering what's up with this "thing" every body calls "Blockchain".

At 20h there was a live demonstration of how to create your own developpement environment for coding and deploying smart contracts on ethereum. A cool journey in the world of smart contracts. Even though it was really geeky stuff, a lot of people stayed with there laptop in the Osmo Cafe until pretty late!
