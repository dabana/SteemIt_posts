# Hydro-Quebec is careful with cryptocurrency mining: another hard blow to the proof-of-work consensus algorithm

I always like it when mainstream medias like Radio-Canada talking about "the blockchain" (the french translation is hylarious: "chaines de blocs"). This afternoon I heard an interview with the minister of energy of Quebec about the new directives given to Hydro-Quebec (the big monopoly producing our electricity) concerning bitcoin mining farms. Very interesting.

Lately, a lot of companies, mainly asian (chinese), have reached out to hydro-quebec for their electricity. It is well known that the hydroelectricity produced in Northern Quebec is cheaper that electricity produced from other sources (like fossile fuel). But these compagnies, call them giant mining pools, are asking for a lot of electricity. If all the demands where accepted, to total consumption would amount to 40% of Hydro-Quebecs (HQ) current production (15 000 MWatts over 37 MWatts)! It is crazy!

Since HQ cannot supply that much juice, they have to be very selective. They will choose the projects that will give more tax return and create the most jobs. The thing is, I doubt any of these project will ever create any descent job or give any appreciable tax return unless the industry is well reglemented, which I doubt is the case. 

Anyhow, since HQ is favorable to blockchain technology in general, because it might someday benefit them, they decided to allow 500 MWatts of their production for the cryptomining industry. Fortunatly, the price of this electricity will be higher, since the demand is so high, and they will require some garanties. 

It is a good start but I think our gouvernement can do better to slow the Proof-Of-Work madness. 

This proof-of-work madness has to stop.
